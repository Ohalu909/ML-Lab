Lab exercise from machine learning course

# Lab description:
## ML Lab1
In this lab work assignment, task assigned is to develop a program that utilizes your knowledge of 
regression techniques to predict house prices based on the given features. I need to 
analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, train, and evaluate different regression models, and 
compare their performance. The dataset for this task is provided, named ‘House Pricing.csv’.

## ML Lab2
In this lab work assignment, task assigned is to perform a systematic analysis on the performance of 
neural network models in classifying the type of wine (red wine / white wine) based on the 
given features. I need to prepare the dataset, train, and evaluate different classifiers 
models, and compare their performance. The dataset for this task is provided, named
‘winequality-white.csv’ and ‘winequality-red.csv’.
