# ML-Lab

Lab exercise from machine learning course

Lab description:
In this lab work assignment, task assigned is to perform a systematic analysis on the performance of 
neural network models in classifying the type of wine (red wine / white wine) based on the 
given features. I need to prepare the dataset, train, and evaluate different classifiers 
models, and compare their performance. The dataset for this task is provided, named
‘winequality-white.csv’ and ‘winequality-red.csv’.
